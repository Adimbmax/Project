        <h1>Sokka</h1>
           <body>Sokka is a fictional character in Nickelodeon's animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender and its sequel series The Legend of Korra.Sokka was born in the Southern Water Tribe village of Wolf Cove to Chief Hakoda and his wife, Kya. He was raised from a young age to be a warrior, and possessed much knowledge of Water Tribe weapons and tactics.  Sokka is usually the one who notices small details and asks a lot of questions. He's the one who reads the maps and provides team Avatar (and the audience) with the crucial element of comic relief. You can't be funny unless you're smart.
