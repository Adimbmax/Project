<P>Tom and Jerry were created by animation duo Hanna-Barbera. Itchy and Scratchy from The Simpsons are a spoof on Tom and Jerry. Tom and Jerry has won seven Academy Awards. Tom and Jerry almost never speak in the classic episodes but are voiced in Tom and Jerry Tales, which debuted in 2005 on Kids' WB.</p>
