Fortnite Battle Royale has joined the ranks of bona fide cultural crazes. It is and will be to the 20-teens what Cabbage Patch Kids and Rubik’s Cubes were to the 1980s: an improbable, unpredictable behemoth of runaway success.
It is not only played by millions daily, but also by way of penetrating the cultural zeitgeist, it is known far and wide among parents and TV watchers who have never so much as picked up a game controller. Even non-gaming people just know about it, and don’t even know how they know. Make sure to check out this list of popular HP OMEN Gaming Laptops to play Fortnite.
